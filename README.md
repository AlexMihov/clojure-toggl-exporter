# clojure-toggl-exporter

A small tool which creates a CSV out of time entries in toggl.
It is built in Clojure, which means that it can be made into a jar and
can run on any machine that has java installed.

## Usage

In the `config.yml` you need to enter your toggl token, the date
range, project id, filename and directory first.

To build the jar file out of this project you need to install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)
Afterwards run this command in the root of the repository.

    lein uberjar

Lastly you can use the program like this.

    $ java -jar clojure-toggl-exporter-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
